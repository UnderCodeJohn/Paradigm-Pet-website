                        are well over 300

                        Adopting a dog offers mutual benefits between dog and owner.
                        Many studies cite the social benefits of having a companion as well as the reduced feelings of
                        loneliness from
                        adopting a dog.

                        If you have a dog, it is important to make sure that you care for your dog; be mindful of what
                        you feed your dog and
                        provide enough opportunities for exercise.

                    <p>Throughout dogs’ lifespans, they should generally be fed fewer meals as they mature. Puppies
                        should be nursed the
                        first two months, then introduced to three meals per day when they are about three to six months
                        years old.
                        <br><br>
                        Their food intake should be reduced to two meals per day when they are six months to one year
                        old and finally reduced to
                        one meal after they reach one year old. And a dog’s typical body mass is composed of somewhere
                        between 60 and 70
                        percent water.
                        <br><br>
                        The <a href="https://www.aspca.org/pet-care/dog-care/dog-nutrition-tips"
                            title="https://www.aspca.org/pet-care/dog-care/dog-nutrition-tips">ASPCA</a> says just a 10
                        percent decrease in body water can cause illness, and a 15 percent loss can
                        cause death, so make sure you keep your pooch hydrated!
                        Much like humans, dogs need to have a healthy level of activity to keep their organs healthy, as
                        well as sun and
                        fresh air.
                        <br><br>
                        The minimum recommended time for exercise varies greatly with breed and size differences, but
                        generally a
                        range of 30–120 minutes of exercise is recommended per day!
                        <br><br>
                        Can you imagine exercising two hours per day? OK, I know
                        that wouldn't bother some of you reading this. But the thought of it to me makes me cringe! And
                        by the way,
                        exercising your dog does not mean you are being challenged to a push-up contest.
                        <br><br>
                        Brisk walks are OK too! You can also choose from a variety of toys to encourage physical
                        activity; just be sure they are age appropriate and do not
                        pose a choking hazard. Pay careful attention to toys that require supervision.

                    <p>Keeping your furry family member clean is important to its health. So be sure to brush frequently
                        to reduce the
                        amount of shedding and prevent matted and tangled fur that can prove to be extremely difficult
                        to remove.
                        <br><br>
                        Check for insects such as ticks and fleas, especially after visiting heavily wooded areas.
                        Bathing is not only important to
                        your dog’s health but can be an exercise depending on how strong willed the dog is.
                        <br><br>
                        Rinse <span class="bold-style">all</span> of the soap out, as any residual soap can result in a
                        rash. Be sure the soap is formulated for your puppy or dog, since harsh soaps can
                        cause allergic reactions. And as always, be careful how you handle your loved one.
                        <br><br>
                        No matter the size of your dog, you need to be cautious as you carry your canine. If you have a
                        small dog, then cradle the pup with one hand under
                        the chest and the forearm supporting the back half. If it is a large dog, reach under the belly
                        with both your arms
                        perpendicular to the dog, and use each arm to support the chest and rear as you lift.

                    <p>You should <span class="bold-style">always</span> consult with your veterinarian, but there is a
                        core set of vaccines
                        that are typically recommended.
                        Vaccines that reduce the exposure risk to things such as hepatitis, rabies, and parvovirus.
                        <br><br>
                        Others may be determined by your vet depending on the environment in which the dog resides. Some
